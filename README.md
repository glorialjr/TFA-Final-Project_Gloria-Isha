**Project Overview**
**Problem statement**: Let’s say your apartment lease is ending at the end of the year, and you need to find a new apartment. There are a lot of criteria you can use to help find a neighborhood you’d like to live in. One thing you care a lot about is a quiet neighborhood with a lot of greenery. 
**What this prject does**: Using NYC Open Data datasets and Zillow’s historic monthly rent averages, we have created a single Jupyter notebook to download, clean, and store data, as well as defining a set of SQL queries and visualizations to help answer questions of yours in search of a great area to live within your budget.
